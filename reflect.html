      <p>This website is created by CSS and HTML only, and it is based on 
      the assignment 5 part B. I upgraded the CSS code to introduced 
      Responsive design, the minimum resolution is 320px and maximum 
      resolution is 1100px.
      All laptop pictures, product discriptions are from Amazon.ca. 
      Except the "Email Me" and "Back To Store" link, all other 
      hyper-link will not take effect because this is only a 1-page 
      website. The photo left sides was taken when I was doing my Bachelor 
      degree in China, which include a short period field study in AVICLUB.</p>

	  <h4>What is Responsive Design</h4>
    <p>The term "Responsive Design", simply speaking is the design for a
     webpage or other apps to make it can adjust its layout instantly 
     according to different screen/media size or resolutions to make sure 
     its content can be easy to read (eliminate or reduce the operation 
     like zooming or scrolling) on any device. However, the Responsive Design 
     generally did not cut out any contents on the webpage, only changed 
     the ways and layouts to show it. Unlike the Adaptive Design methods, 
     which are showing only the webpages designed for a specific device, 
     once the type of devices has been identified by the website, only 
     change screen size are not immediately reflect on the way of the 
     website present. The website will be showing more content on a desktop 
     computer and cut out some unnecessary elements for a mobile phone, 
     no matter exactly the size of the screen.</p>
     <h4>Why we need it?</h4>
     <p>As more and more mobile devices have the capability for browsing 
     webpages, and the operation mode for mobile devices is different than 
      traditional desktop devices (for example, mobile devices generally 
      use touch-screen instead of using external input device—although some 
      devices can do so), therefore, a web designer cannot directly present 
      the original webpage that designed for traditional desktop PC to a mobile 
      device. In the beginning, web designers are attempting to make a separate 
      design to mobile devices, however, not all devices have the same screen size, 
      it is impossible to adapt all devices. What's more, even for the 
      traditional devices that the screen is standardized, like desktop 
      or laptop computers, not all users are set their web browser to a 
      full-screen mode, so we cannot assume a certain size that works 
      for all users in the real world. To address these issues, 
      the concept of responsive design was firstly proposed by an 
      independent web designer Ethan Marcotte in 2010, but he used 
      another term called Responsive Web Design(RWD). In his article 
      "Responsive Web Design " published on A List Apart, he applied and 
      integrated three techniques, like media query, fluid grid, and flexible image. </p>

	 <h4>How about this assessment?</h4>
    <p>Nowadays, more and more websites are transformed into Responsive 
    Design. To achieve the goal, I this final assignment, I am using 
    the CSS media query and set the screen size to 3 different levels, 
    less than 320px(for mobile phone), 320 to 800 px(for large screen 
    mobile phone or tablets) and 800px to 1100px (for traditional desktop). 
    Because my screen is slightly larger than that, so I can change the 
    size of my browser window to simulate the changing size of the screen, 
    and the webpage layout is changed following the size changed. No matter 
    what the window size changed, there is no horizontal scrolling required 
    to browsing the whole web pages.</p>
    
    <h4>And for the future...</h4>
    <p>In the future, more and more new devices(like smartwatches) may
     be able to use for browse the Internet, each device will have its 
     screen size, to adapt the webpages based on these devices one-by-one 
     is impossible. Responsive design seems like a good way which allowed 
     us to keep a single website and reduce the workload on operation and 
     maintenance, once we need to update the website, we only have to 
     update in a single point. However, as the layout and content go more 
     and more complex, there is also a great challenge to do the responsive
      design, the design team may have to spend more time on html5/css3 
      coding. Even though, the website with responsive design is not always 
      working as they wish. Base on my own experience, some websites have
       a better browsing experience on a mobile phone than a traditional 
       desktop. For another few websites, the font size is too small for 
       the senior user, which means they need zooming—that is the mobile 
       website needs to avoid. Although there are some un-user friendly 
       scenario occurs, we can still believe that the responsible design 
       guideline is the future for web app design.</p>
